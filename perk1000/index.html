<h1 class="text-center">Personal House Concert</h1>

<p>
If you (or several of you together) believe in our festival enough to donate
$1000, it would be our honor to come play a concert for you at your home. We
would love to say thank you in person with a full show of old-time tunes,
ballads, scottish tunes, and blues for you and your friends. We'll also include
two tickets to the Sing &amp; Stomp so that you can enjoy all the other music
and dancing. This massive donation is humbling beyond words and would secure
your name in the Midwest Sing &amp; Stomp Hall of Fame.
